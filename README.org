#+title: MetaDataScrapper


* TODOs
** DONE Fix ~.~ Dependency
In ~MetaFacebook.PageLikes(string)~, likes are read using a string like: "DESCRIPTION:
‎مخطوطات عربية على لوحات فنية كلاسيكية‎. 2,312 likes · 420 talking about this. Arts &amp;
humanities website" from the html source meta tags, currently  it uses '.' to separate each
portion from the string (name, likes, talking about). This might break if the passed value
had a '.' in the name.
*** Resolved
Resolved using '·' char to detect the end of likes, last '.' to detect end of title.
